##Team 4 Research Question

Research Question

Original Research Question:

● How can we use foldable robotic techniques to design a compressible robot capable of
navigating through tight spaces?

Refined Research Question:

● How can folding techniques be used to design self-collapsible robots capable of scaling
tight and inclined spaces?


#Tractability
  Our team has refined the initial research question by focusing more on tightly inclined spaces.
Although our robot design will still have the ability to pass through tight spaces, it will focus more on
climbing and descending angled terrain. Similar to the compression traits seen in a cockroach, our design
will be able to collapse its body when squeezing through compact terrains. The design will also have the
ability to expand its body when climbing through angled spaces; allowing the robot to heighten its
traction without the use of high power motors or suction based technologies. In order to minimize cost
and materials, the prototype will be constructed primarily from layered paper composite. Additionally,
foldable robotic techniques will be implemented to minimize the use of bulky and expensive actuators.
Although there are similar compressible designs being researched, our prototype will aim to expand robot
accessibility to tight crevices that change in size.
#Novelty
  To initialize our team's literature review, words like cockroach, crawl, compressibe, shrink, tight,
space, small, cracks, climbing, squish, and foldable were used to narrow down the research results.The
four highly cited references that closely resemble our research question included:
1. Berkeley’s CRAM Robot
  Similar to our design approach, Berkeley’s department of biology based their design from
the features of a cockroach. They experimented with cockroaches to see how they maneuvered
through tight and horizontal crevices smaller than a quarter of their standing body height. After
testing with live insects, they designed the compressible robot with articulated mechanisms or
CRAM [3]. Although CRAM was successfully able to move through compressed horizontal
crevices, Berkeley’s team of engineers did not focus their design on angled slopes which is a
huge factor in real world applications.
2. Berkeley’s RoACH Robot
  Similar to their CRAM robotic cockroach design, Berkeley expanded their research and
created RoACH. The autonomous 2.4g hexapod robot is made from S2-Glass reinforced
composite. The design is capable of mimicking the motion and speed of a cockroach with only
two actuators [1]. The robot is quick, lightweight, inexpensive, and uses legs rather than wheels.
Although RoACH has significant advantages over its wheeled counterparts, such as traveling
through rough terrains, it fails to traverse on inclined surfaces due to the small surface area of the
six legged robot.
3. Ritsumeikan’s Deformable Robot
  Ritsumeikan University decided to take a different approach when designing their
deformable robot. The team of engineers did not base their design on a cockroach. In fact, their
design isn’t based on any creatures of nature; it is simply a circular mechanism made from soft
materials. The soft robot uses actuators to deform its body. Repeated deformation of the robot's
body enables the robot to move in a continuous motion [4]. Additionally, the deformation allows
for elastic potential to become stored. When released rapidly enough, the robot can generate an
impulse large enough to propel it over rigid bodies of land. Although Ritsumeikan’s design is
capable of moving in two directions, deforming its body, and jumping over objects, it cannot
move on an inclined plane because the robot does not use torque to move.
4. HARP Robotic Probe
  HARP is a highly articulated probe designed to travel through tight and curved areas for
surgical purposes. This probe uses conventional actuation while maintaining maneuverability.
HARP also has the ability to curve its body in three dimensional space with only three actuators
[2]. Although it is not used to navigate through tight crevices due to its large diameter, the probe
uses a limited amount of actuators to control its position along a curved pathway.

#Interesting
  Research in the field of Robotics is always on the lookout for solutions that are smart, affordable,
readily available, have less impact on the environment, and so forth. In recent years, people have been
connecting with each other through the internet, more than they have in the past. This paves the way for
those who notice issues that happen all over the world to spread awareness of them. In the same manner,
Robotics has gained attention in society, at large. An everyday person is interested and ready to invest in
technology that is helpful and affordable for them. It is in our best interest, as engineers, to create new and
update existing technology for the very same reason.
  Since the invention of the computer in the 1940s, focus has mainly been on upgrading
microprocessors, better software to run commands and such. Eventually, this led to affordable and
compact electronics for everyday use. Even though Control System Engineering has been around for quite
some time, there have only been advances in applications like automobiles for the common man. Other
applications are related to machinery used in factories, defense or aircraft. An interest in smaller, more
compact devices or those that autonomously make themselves compact is gaining traction in the
engineering community. This is because the use of a small robot is being recognized as highly efficient in
areas such as the exploration of unsafe environments, safety robots etc. Foldable robotics comes from two
extremely different fields: Robotics and Origami which are branches of Engineering and Art. Exploring
this field to find solutions for existing and future issues is underway.
  It can be very difficult for minor companies to experiment with and further their own research
regarding robotics. Currently, large corporations in the robotic systems market tend to play a larger role,
and have the backing of big investors, who supply them with better resources for research to advance their
products than smaller businesses. Minor companies depend on existing devices or need devices that work
within their budget. Creating a cheap base robot on which experiments and tests can be done allows for
rapid prototyping. Once a viable solution has been created, it can then be modified for use in a variety of
applications. For example, some environmental changes would require a change in materials. The base
robot could also be equipped with additional sensors depending on the specific application. With further
research, applications to the community in general can be found. Regarding the general community, small
robots that are efficient, affordable, maintainable, and easy to use will make it relatively convenient for
the average person to obtain them and the benefits they come with, from entertainment to healthcare.
  Looking at some of the applications in which a foldable robotic system could be used, a basic
search regarding an adaptable robot that is able to navigate through varying inclined environments,
suggests that it would be particularly useful for navigating through terrain that is unfit or impossible for
humans to traverse through, such as small spaces, radioactive environments, etc. Given the ability to
traverse through these environments, it could also be used live feed in disasters such as landslides, mine
collapses, etc, where initial responses can be slow, as these environments can be too unstable for a quick
manual search . Also, robots that can autonomously or semi-autonomously navigate through underground
passageways can be used for preventive analysis by preemptively scouting out and mapping an area
whose conditions and stability may be unknownA robot that is similar to a cockroach that is proverbially
said to be able survive a nuclear holocuast is an interesting idea.
  Advances in this field is an eye-opener for further innovations. Many organisms already have
very efficient systems. Bio-inspired robots take advantage of these systems by replicating those found in
said organisms. This research plans on using bio-inspiration combined with foldable robotics techniques
which can potentially help pave the way for further developments that can improve existing applications
such as wheelchairs for the paraplegic, large-scale manufacturing in factories, etc.
Open-ended
  This research focus is extremely open-ended. If this investigation is used as the baseline, a more
effective and efficient self collapsing tiny structure could be realized. Given more time and resources, the
lessons learned from this research could be used to tweak and alter the designs to provide a superior
concept, leading to better foldable mechanics; thus, leading to the progression of this concept along with
the field as a whole. Furthermore, the idea of traversing a variety of tight and inclined spaces with
minimal physical footprint has numerous applications in mining and exploration , potentially finding
places previously unknown. Foldable robotics that are cheap, as well as easy to assemble and operate may
be an economically advantageous market for future exploration endeavors.

#Modular
  Researching self-collapsable robots that are capable of traversing inclines within small areas has
significant compatibility with other research topics for foldable robotics. The collapsibility factor is a
highly desirable attribute when dealing with nearly all applications of robotics. Being able to take the
lessons learned within this research and applying them elsewhere to make other robotic systems smaller
and able to traversing inclined spaces speaks to its own rewards. If this research shows applicability of
mechanisms that are simple yet effective at scaling inclines, they could be added to robots with different
functions, increasing versatility and function. Ultimately, any research which yields any small
improvement in the field could have untold complementary application value.

#Team fit
  Of the members in this team, three have a focus in robotics engineering, while the fourth has a
focus on manufacturing. At least one team member has always loved folding origami, a core principle of
foldable robotics, as the system needs to be able to collapse and fold in on itself either to take up less
space, assemble in a specific way, or to add structural integrity to the system or part. As engineering
students, members of this team have had to be able to visualize and design unique systems, taking into
consideration electrical, software, and mechanical aspects. In manufacturing and robotics, it is important
to be able to take various components together to create one (or more) working systems. This team has a
mix of members who have experience with the more hands-on aspect as well as those who have more
experience with the theoretical and simulation aspects. Combined, this team should be equipped to take
on the challenges of this research from multiple angles.

#Topic fit
  In order to adapt to different physical spaces, a robot that is capable of manipulating its own
dimensions would be perfectly suited to traverse a wide range of inclined, if not completely vertical,
surfaces. Foldable robotics techniques can equip a robot with the ability to both self-expand and collapse,
which is perfect when taking into account the fact that the solution to this question should have a high
level of adaptability so as to be usable in a wide range of scenarios and environments. Depending on the
level of complexity or durability the robot needs, different folding techniques will need to be taken into
account, as some folds can create stronger structures than others. There will need to be a balance between
rigidity and flexibility when finding a viable solution, two aspects that are crucial when designing a
foldable robotic system
